# Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains beginner-to-intermediate **Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects** along with structured learning notebooks.

## ML Basics
Covers essential ML foundations and preprocessing steps:
- **Statistics_for_ML** → Descriptive statistics, distributions
- **Data_Preprocessing** → Scaling, encoding, missing value handling
- **Supervised_Learning** → Linear regression, classification algorithms

## Deep Learning
Covers neural network concepts and advanced architectures:
- **Neural_Networks** → NN basics, activation functions
- **CNN_RNN** → CNN for images, RNN for sequential/time-series data

## ML Projects
Practical projects demonstrating end-to-end ML workflow:
- **Linear_Regression.ipynb** → Predicting continuous values
- **Classification_Iris.ipynb** → Classifying iris species
- **Titanic_Analysis.ipynb** → Predicting survival on the Titanic dataset
- **Digit_Recognition_MNIST.ipynb** → Handwritten digit classification
- **Text_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb** → Basic NLP sentiment analysis

## Workflow in Notebooks
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Training
4. Evaluation
5. Visualizations

**Note:** Each notebook is self-contained with explanations, code, and outputs for easy understanding.
